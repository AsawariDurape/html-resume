    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h4>August- October 2022 <br />VeeAR Projects - Technical Recruiter</h4>
    <p>
      As the first person to engage with qualified job seekers, I had to screen
      them, and submit their profiles to our clients/your manager if those
      jobseekers were qualified. Search for other qualified jobseekers through
      job boards, social media platforms, or various other Job portals. Submit
      vetted candidates, who are qualified, to the end client/Team Manager.
      Also, I had to work on job requirements for some of the hottes jobs in the
      market, and from some of the largest and most-reputable Fortune 500
      clients in the U.S. like Apple, Google, and Facebook.
